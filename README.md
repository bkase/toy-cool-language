# Toy cool langauge

A type checker and interpreter for Sound and Complete Bidirectional Typechecking for Higher-Rank Polymorphism with Existentials and Indexed Types (Joshua Dunfield, Neelakantan R. Krishnaswami).

## Complete

So far I have the syntax of values, expressions, types, sorts, etc represented as OCaml types.

## TODO

Literally everything else
